#Parameters
#   x-> represents the maximum x-coordinate contained in a cuboid starting at 0
#   y-> represents the maximum y-coordinate contained in a cuboid starting at 0
#   z-> represents the maximum z-coordinate contained in a cuboid starting at 0
#   n-> integer representing the value which x+y+z cannot equal
#Output
#   Prints all 3-dimensional points represented by integers in a cuboid whose coordinates to not sum to given number n
